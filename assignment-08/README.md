1. An affordance is the property of an object, physical or digital, that defines what the object is intended to be used for. Like in the assignment we labeled our videos accordingly to what they were. It is letting you know what will heppen if you click on said video.
2. The advantages of having a third party hosting your videos is the fact that it can get public views and you can profit from this. It allows your video to be seen by anyone looking for similiar content on the platform. The disadvantages to having them there is they are only accesible when internet is, and it has to be according to the sites regulations (I hope people aren't posting bad stuff).
3. I faced challenges with getting the embeded code and making sure that all of it was there. I kept rewatching the tutorial until I was able to figure out the mistake that i was making.
