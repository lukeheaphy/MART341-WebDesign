1. I have come across several different forms that respectively serve useful but different purposes. Some of the most notable ones that I have done are when signing up for certain shoe raffles. You have to fill out personal and payment information to enter this drawing. Another form that I often see online is when inquiring about a service from a business. A lot of websites such as tattoo parlors have a section on their website to where you can get in contact with an artist and can accurately relay information about the request. Forms can be useful in getting in contact with potential or current customers.
