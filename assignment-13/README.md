1. The goal of VNDS is for local kids to have a shoe and vintage store to go to. I remember when I was younger I hated the fact that I lived in Montana. For one reason only, I could only buy shoes online. VNDS will give kids that ability to have a cool shoe store just like I wish I always had. It will have a real product list with real images of my own. I dont think it will be functional to actually buy something on it but I would like it to be close to that point when I finish
2. Responsive web design is important because if a website is not working how the user is expecting then they might get frusterated and stop looking at your website. If you want to be able to show something off or sell something properly then the website should be smooth and easy to use.
