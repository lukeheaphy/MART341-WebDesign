How did your user testing sessions go?

I did not use any of these opportunities as i had my idea pretty much ready to go. There is just quite a bit I have to still finish in order for the website to be fully functional and asthetically acceptable.
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
Same story. Fun fact I was unsure as to how I can make the buttons on the menu functional so I used some forms on reddit to help me... Did not end up being that hard though
Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
time, grind at night.
